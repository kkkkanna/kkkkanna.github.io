<h3><u>About me</u></h3>
   <p>My name is <b>Gabriel</b> (<i>aka "kanna", which I go by online</i>).<br>I'm just a guy from Brazil who is trying his best to get everything right in his life.<br><br>Yes, I have autism.</p>
<h3><u>My interests</u></h3>
   <p></p>I really love videogames and technology, they're by far my favorite hobbies. I especially<br>like the difficult games, like <b>Celeste</b>, <b>Geometry Dash</b> and<b> Super Meat Boy</b>,<br>beacause they actually give me a challenge.</p>
   <p>I also really like speedcubing, where you solve a <b>Rubik's Cube</b> as fast as possible. <br><i>The Rubik's Cube speedrun.</i><br> Yeah, just a typical nerd thing. If you care, my best time is 20 seconds.</p>   
<h3><u>...Nerd section?</u></h3>
   <p><b>I use arch btw</b> (<i>Or, at least, I used to</i>). Before Arch, I used Ubuntu, but I thought Arch was pretty cool,<br>so that's what I started using.<br>I had to stop using Linux because I have stuff that I need to do on Windows,<br>but my PC can't run a VM well and I started running out of space<br>to dualboot, so I had to give up Linux.</p>
   <p><b><i>But be assured, this isn't the end. I will come back<br>when I get a new computer.<br>I always come back.</i></b></p>
<h3><u>About this website</u></h3>
   <p>I made this website because I'm really interested in game/web development<br>and I wanted to try it for myself, <i>so I spent an entire Saturday morning reading the w3schools HTML<br>tutorial and trying to get something going.</i> I also really wanted something that told<br>more about me! Discord's about me is really tiny. </p>
   <p>Massive thanks to <a href="https://github.com/LeonhardTissen">Leonhard Tissen</a> for giving me the $2 I needed to purchase the domain for this (<i>kanna69.xyz</i>)</p>
   <p>You might be wondering why the domain is "kanna69.xyz" when I use "kanna420". <i>Well...</i><br>The domain "kanna420.xyz" <i>is somehow taken???</i> Like... Who tf would want to<br>get that domain aside from me??? That was<br>MY namespace... Sure then, I guess.</p>
<h4>Thanks for reading!</h4>
